- Advice for started
  - If I could make you do ONE thing: test raising prices
    - Highest leverage thing I've done
    - If I created a new B2B SaaS: $49/$99/$249
    - If I created an info product: same
    - FormKeep's pricing models
      - Pay what you want
      - Honor system $9 personal / $29 commercial
      - $19 / form / month
        - Penalized our best customers
      - Tiers, bottom is $29 (huge win)
        - Ungrandfathered
        - MRR went up 20% in a day
      - Uber
        - Losing $3B/year == $95/second
        - Paying us $29 / month
        - Hid lowest tier, now it's $59/month (double)
        - New trials went down slightly, but more than made up for in ARPU
    - Upcase, other way
      - We had 18%-20% churn constantly
      - "If it were cheap I'd stay subscribed"
      - Dropped $99 -> $29
      - Guess what happened
        - Huge revenue hit
        - Churn went up
        - Quality of forum discussion went down
      - Oops: should have TESTED, duh.
    - Concrete advice:
      - Put a reminder on your calendar for every 6 months to test pricing
      - Here's your first test: double your prices
        - Don't even have to charge new amount, just update pricing page
    - Reasons you'll balk
      - You're worried about existing cust. or people seeing diff prices
        - Easy support issue
      - Your competitor charges less
        - FormKeep has a competitor that charges $9.99, none of our customers have heard of them
          - They're cheap but bad at marketing, so their pricing is irrelevant
    - Social proof
      - John Norman
        "One key lesson we learned early on was not to charge too little. $5/month
        customers are just terrible. They have the highest rate of failed payments,
        the highest rate of credit card fraud, the highest amount of support tickets
        submitted, and are the least friendly people. We've doubled our prices 3x
        since then, and each time we do, we get nicer people who value the product
        more and create fewer problems."

- Conclusion
  - That's my talk
  - If you haven't started yet
    - Don't wait for inspiration, just start
    - When you start, begin by teaching
    - When you make your product, start small
  - If you have started
    - Put a reminder on your calendar to test pricing ever 6 months
    - When you test, prefer tests that raise prices
  - If you're in either group and you need help: email me

#### Bad reasons to charge less

- You understand how simple your code is.

- You think it'll reduce churn.

- Your competitors charge less

- It hurts your feelings when people say it's too expensive.

- "Everybody knows this stuff"


#### Stories

One key lesson we learned early on was not to charge too little. $5/month
customers are just terrible. They have the highest rate of failed payments,
the highest rate of credit card fraud, the highest amount of support tickets
submitted, and are the least friendly people. We've doubled our prices 3x
since then, and each time we do, we get nicer people who value the product
more and create fewer problems.

  Results after the first couple of months:

  * Trial to paid conversions stayed the same
  * Churn stayed the same

## Onboarding

### Lesson: It's highly worth your time to watch strangers sign up for your product.

Can't be objective about your own product
Don't need a ton of users to get good data

### Lesson: Some text is more valuable than others

H1s and button text are the highest-value areas
Less text is generally better, since it's more likely to actually be read

### Lesson: Decisions cause anxiety.

Default stuff in
Editing existing defaults doesn't cause the same anxiety
