  - Raise your prices
    - Your pricing should make you uncomfortable
    - The highest-leverage thing I've done on any product I've worked on is testing pricing
    - Specific ideas:
      - Add tiers
      - Hide the lowest tier
        - FormKeep
        - Uber
        - Losing $3B/year == $95/second
        - Show graph of new trials
      - Add an enterprise plan that says "call us", quote the biggest number you can say without laughing
  - Watch folks sign up for your product






### How to pay off MicroConf

Promise to run a pricing test
  1. Add tiers
  2. Hide the lowest tier
      FormKeep
      Uber
      Losing $3B/year == $95/second
      Show graph of new trials
  3. Add an enterprise plan that says "call us", quote the biggest number you
     can say without laughing

#### Pricing rules of thumb

- B2B SaaS: $49 / $99 / $249

- Info product: $49 / $99 / $249 

- You should lose customers over pricing.
  You *want* to hear that your product is too expensive for some folks.

#### Bad reasons to charge less

- You understand how simple your code is.

- You think it'll reduce churn.

- It hurts your feelings when people say it's too expensive.

- "Everybody knows this stuff"

- You don't understand how businesses buy things:

  The $80 delta makes absolutely no difference to the decisionmaker at the
  agency. To you or me, $80 means a very nice dinner for that special someone.
  To an employee, $80 of the company's money means absolutely nothing:
  compared next to non-software items on the budget (e.g. a single employee's
  salary) it is a joke, and economizing for the $80 a month a) achieves no
  substantial business goal, b) does not result in a pat-on-the-head from the
  boss, and c) does not result in the employee getting to go out to a marginal
  dinner." (from patio11 post)

#### Stories

- One key lesson we learned early on was not to charge too little. $5/month
  customers are just terrible. They have the highest rate of failed payments,
  the highest rate of credit card fraud, the highest amount of support tickets
  submitted, and are the least friendly people. We've doubled our prices 3x
  since then, and each time we do, we get nicer people who value the product
  more and create fewer problems.

  Results after the first couple of months:

  * Biggest revenue increase I’ve ever had in a single month
  * Average revenue per customer more than doubled
  * Very minor drop in visitor to trial conversions
  * Trial to paid conversions stayed the same
  * Churn stayed the same

## Onboarding

### Lesson: It's highly worth your time to watch strangers sign up for your product.

Can't be objective about your own product
Don't need a ton of users to get good data

### Lesson: Some text is more valuable than others

H1s and button text are the highest-value areas
Less text is generally better, since it's more likely to actually be read

### Lesson: Decisions cause anxiety.

Default stuff in
Editing existing defaults doesn't cause the same anxiety
